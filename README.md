# BetVictor-Test
Interview Task:

I. Automatation test

As a result of current situation I had to perform task away from my PC. I was not able to use Git and other software.
Test was written in Notepad. I have attached few files which led me to final version of this task. Below there is description of stages I have made to improve first, basic code to final version. 

1. First version of test was regular form of code line by line (no classes - 1st version.rb).
2. Later, I built working prototype using classes, however variable driver (contains web browser firefox) was transferred to methods as argument while running each method (2nd version.rb).
3. I changed variable driver to be accessible by constructor and shared to every method. I also made separated variables to transfer input data for methods (phone number, post code).
